-- SNA — player photo uploads (Supabase Storage)
--   Replaces the paste-a-URL photo field with file uploads. Photos live in a
--   public 'player-photos' bucket, one folder per team so objects can't
--   collide, and profiles.photo_url stores the object's public URL — all
--   existing Avatar display code keeps working unchanged.
--   Safe to re-run.

-- 1. Public bucket (5 MB cap, image types only) ------------------------------

  array['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp', 'image/gif']

on conflict (id) do update
  set public = excluded.public,
      file_size_limit = excluded.file_size_limit,
      allowed_mime_types = excluded.allowed_mime_types;
